EcoScan: Greenwashing Detector
EcoScan is a mobile application designed to help consumers identify potential "greenwashing" on product labels. Using Tesseract OCR and a FastAPI backend, the app scans labels for vague sustainability buzzwords and provides an "Eco-Score" based on the transparency of the marketing.

🚀 Features
Live Camera Scan: Capture product labels directly through the app interface.

Real-time OCR: Uses Tesseract to extract text from physical labels or digital screens.

Dynamic Image Processing: Includes auto-contrast, grayscale conversion, and sharpening to improve text recognition in various lighting conditions.

Greenwashing Database: Compares extracted text against a database of common vague marketing terms (e.g., "all-natural," "pure," "earth-friendly").

Eco-Score: Provides an instant rating (0-100) based on the number of suspicious buzzwords detected.
